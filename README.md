# Detecting-Malicious-URL-ML-project
This repository contains file related to a machine learning project. It was created during college summer training in 2022. The goal of this project is to detect malicious URL and classify them as good or bad mainly using Logistic Regression Algorithm and MultinomialNB. I developed this project along with my partner Sparsh Jain.
